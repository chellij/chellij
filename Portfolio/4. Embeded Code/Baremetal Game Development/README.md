_**This project was assigned by university as a practical way to learn about embedded systems and baremetal programming in C.**_

Using an STM32F429Zi Nucleo Board and a "Game Board" designed by the university, I had to design a game based around the LCD using the elements available to me. However I was only allowed to use standard c libraries and my knowledge of bare metal programming. 

The game I chose was an endless runner game, with a running man who jumps up or down to avoid obstacles moving towards him. I made use of the USART, ADC, Timers, LEDs, Onboard Buttons, and Buzzer for this game and was very proud of my end result. The code can be found within this folder and a demonstration can be seen using the link below.

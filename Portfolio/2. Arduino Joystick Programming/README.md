The aim of this project was to use an arduino to learn motor basics and how to use an analogue signal, motor or potentiometer, to control a stepper motor and a servo motor. As shown in the video link. This code is able to control the DC motor speed and direction, control the Stepper Motor Speed and direction, control the Servo Motor Position and by pushing the joystick down, I can switch the stepper motor between Full step, Half step and Micro stepping modes.

Additionally, although not shown in the video, the serial monitor displays
* Servo Angle
* Joystick Position in X & Y
* DC Motor PWM and Direction values
* Stepper Motor Stepping method and direction

This is still all without additional libraries.

I also drew up a basic schematic of this project for my own understanding and so that someone else viewing the code can visualise the project.

_**This project was assigned by university as a practical way to learn about embedded systems and baremetal programming.**_

Using an STM32F429Zi Nucleo Board and a "Game Board" designed by the university, I had to design a game based around the LCD using the elements available to me. However I was only allowed to use standard c libraries and my knowledge of bare metal programming. 

The game I chose was a dodgeball type game, with a running man who jumps up or down to avoid obstacles moving towards him. I made use of the USART, ADC, Timers, LEDs, Onboard Buttons, and Buzzer for this game and was very proud of my end result.

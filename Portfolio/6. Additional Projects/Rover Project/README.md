*This was a group project that was set by university using an STM32F429ZI Nucleo
Development board as the basis for a buggy that should push beads over a line. Due to
COVID-19, we were not able to finish the project in a practical sense as we could not access
the labs to 3D print or laser cut the components of our design. However my group and I
were ahead of the majority of the class and so decided to continue our design and finish
the CAD model. I have included a link to the public access of this model and my final report
of the project to show the practical work that was completed. We used MBED to write the 
code for this project although I have put the code in this repository for easy access and reading*

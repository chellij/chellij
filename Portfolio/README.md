Hi, I am Rachel! 

I have just finished my final year of a Robotics (BEng) degree at the University of Plymouth. I spent five years at university, undertaking a foundation year, a three-year degree and a year in industry. My placement was with [CMR Surgical](https://cmrsurgical.com/) in Cambridge, and I had an incredible time in the Research and Strategy department in the Robotics team.

I was first introduced to robotics during my A-Levels and loved the combination of design and code. It was, however, only at university that I realised how many different aspects of robotics there are and how many sectors of life robots can be used in. I am open to all opportunities to learn more about the various uses however, I passionately care that my work will create a positive impact within the world, whether this be within medical, environmental, sustainable, or an entirely new field.

# My Portfolio

Although I am at the beginning of my career in Robotics, I have included a few projects in this repository to show some of my electrical and robotic engineering skills. 
Some of these projects were completed as part of my academic learning and some are hobbies and self-taught skills. I have included overviews of each project as readme files, code, photos and videos where applicable.

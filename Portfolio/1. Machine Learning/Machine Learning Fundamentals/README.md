<h1> Machine Learning Fundamentals </h1> 
<h3> 2022 </h3>

_**This project was assigned by university as a practical way to learn about machine learning fundamentals and neural networks.**_

This coursework consists of five tasks that will result in a simple kinematic controller that will operate a simulated 2-joint revolute arm and trace a path through a maze. 
1. Data generation for learning the control of the arm. This task requires using a MATLAB forward kinematic model of the arm.
2. Implement the feedforward and training passes of a 2-layer neural network.
3. Learn the inverse kinematic model of the arm using a 2-layer NN.
4. Calculate the trajectory through a maze through reinforcement learning.
5. Use the NN-based inverse kinematic model of the arm learned in Task 3 onto the trajectory generated by the RL-based trajectory planner in Task 4.

_*Final Year Project on Chess Board and Piece Recognition*_

The code has been reduced to basics to be submited for marking, full code can be requested if wanted.

### Abstract 
This [report](./PROJ324_RIJ.pdf) describes the development of a machine learning algorithm for chess detection and analysis. The algorithm detects the chess pieces and their locations on a board, displays the game status on a graphical user interface (GUI) and generates a game code that can be used to resume a physical game online. The report reviews the relevant machine learning methods for object detection, computer vision techniques for chessboard detection and training procedures for new models. The report evaluates and compares fifteen models created with Roboflow, Ultralytics Hub, YOLOv5 and Python using five datasets on three platforms. The evaluation metrics include mean average precision (mAP), recall, precision and object and class loss graphs. The report finds that Roboflow is the most integrated solution, but local training provides more flexibility and customization. The report identifies the main limitations and future improvements of the algorithm: real time detection and dataset diversity. Real time detection is feasible with this system but slow and resource-demanding, so the final design does not run in real time. Dataset diversity could be increased by using more images with different chess sets, scenarios, and cameras with better resolution.

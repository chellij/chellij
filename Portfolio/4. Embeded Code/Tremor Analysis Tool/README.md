_**This project was assigned by university as a practical way to learn about embedded C++ code, multi-threading and embedded sensors.**_

Using an STM32F429Zi Nucleo Board and a "Module Support Board" designed by the university, I designed a multi-threaded software solution to detect tremors and calculate the frequency of the movement. The solution contained both a simulated result (when a MEMs board was not connected) and a
